# ANALYSIS-OF-PATIENT-HEALTH-CARE-RECORD

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

SOURCE: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for data science projects.
	Our project explores a comprehensive healthcare dataset, with each record representing an individual patient’s healthcare journey. This dataset offers insights into various aspects of healthcare management, patient demographics, and medical information. It includes 15 columns, each capturing a unique component of the patient’s healthcare experience.   
    The columns are categorized into the following groups 
Patient Information: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type. 
Medical information: Medical condition,  Medication, Test Result 
Admission Information: Date of Admission, Admission Type, Discharge Date, Room Number, Doctor, Hospital
 Financial Information:  Insurance Provider and Billing Amount.

 Data Cleaning & TRansformation

 I identified and removed 564 rows from the dataset.
 I restructured the NAME column using the Function called Proper, because the name contained inconsistent casing
 I created an AGE GROUP using Power Query.
 I removed "and" from the start or end of hospital names in the Hospital column, standardizing the data for cleaner and more consistent analysis.
